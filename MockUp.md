# npProject


## Introduction

This work was done as part of my training at BeCode. This is our final project, done solo. 

The aim of this project is to propose a platform allowing older people to meet people, whether they are friends or even lovers. Because we live in a society where it is more difficult to have a social life when you are older, this application will help to remedy this problem. It works very much like a social network that we all know. The difference is in the aesthetics (very clean) to make it simple and effective for users.

## Requirement

For this project I've used the following tools:
* React
* Firebase
* Material UI
* Express
* React Redux
